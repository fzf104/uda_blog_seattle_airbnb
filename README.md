This is an assignment of udacity datascientist course. I choosed dataset of Seattle Airbnb and would like to having a deep looking by data exploring. I'm trying to answer 3 questions:
1. How many property types of airbnb and their price were in Seattle?
2. When to visit Seattle is most economy for family tourists living in airbnb?
3. Is reviews helpful for choosing airbnb?

## 3. Summary of the results of the analysis
------------------------------------------------
- There were 16 types of airbnb properties in Seattle. Most of them were house and apartment offering entire home or private room.
- There were seasonal and weekend effect on price of airbnbs in Seattle. It's possible for planning an economy tour by proper arrangement.
